            Well, to start I have to say that I was borned on August 3rd, 1994 in the afternoon,
            I'm the second child they had, my daughter Debbie is 3 years older than me and
            basically she took care of me the same way my dads did it. She was my best friend for
            a long time, most of the time joking at me and bothering for her own benefit, but at
            the end she loved me so much.
          </p>

          <p class="Italic">
            My parents were quite good with me (I have to say that my mom a bit more), they made
            me grow happy and giving me the best education they could afford with their wages.
            My mom, Rosella, is a women originary from Guanacaste province, since my dad is
            originary from San Jose province, they met for the first time because of my aunt
            Anabelle (from my mom's family), got married with a brother of an aunt of my dad,
            German, they all lived together in a kind of private family neighborhood from German's
            side. Then my dad came to visit sometimes his aunt and then the magic came up when my
            dad finally met my mom in that neighborhood, 18 years old was my dad, 20 years old my
            mom, a beauty curly-haired woman that soon fell in love with a green-eyed man. And yup,
            non of us inherited their good qualities XD

            Getting back to my childhood, Tabata basically was my first friend (or at least the one
            that I remember), her mom took care of my sister and me during all our childhood, Tabata
            and I went to the school together, we were classmates until I was 10 years old, then her
            family had to go to live to La Aurora because of personal problems. Good thing here is
            that she was not my only friend, I also had Tommy, Arson, Melvin and Danny, we played
            together the wole time, we had many games, the most popular among us was named "cuadro",
            it was quite simple, the street in front of my home was kind of squared, thus each of us
            took a square and basically none of us could left the ball fall into our square, the one
            that failed in this was out of the game (or gave them 3 opportunities? I don't remember).

            When I was a child I was so problematic, in one hand I suffered bullying in the school,
            but a real bad bullying, there was three kids that punched me just because I was fat,
            they dook me by my arms and legs and then the other kid punched me so hard. In the other
            hand I was always curious, all the time I invented tools that usually failed in their
            intended use and ended hurting somebody. Right now I remember a kind of bus that I made
            to take all my friends on it to get down the hill of my town, we all ended in the ground
            with many abrasions.

            In the school I was also not so good, I had many attention problems, but at some point
            of my life the teacher Francisco came to my life and gave me the motivation I needed to
            become a better student, he basically offered me to let me get into the team named "los
            abanderados", it was an exclusive team composed by the best students of the school, they
            were the owners of carrying the Costa Rica'n flag during the independence procession
            celebration that is made in Costa Rica, I was so excited because everybody would see that
            I was a good student at a level that I deserved to be part of that team. XD Then I really
            improved my scores, and when I was 12 years old I led that team. :D
