          Here is when everything start to become less innocent and more problematic, I was not a handsome guy at all, I was a kiddo with so much acne, skinny and
          without any flirting hability, but with high beauty standards to choose the girls I like XD My very first love in the highschool was a classmate in 8th
          grade, she was a popular girl, with many other boys following her. For some reason we matched each other as friends, her home was in my way to the highschool,
          so I took her with me everyday to the school, and then we became kind of best friends.

          The problem with this potential relationship was that she had a boyfriend, and a problematic one, a junk man whose main way to deal with his economic problems
          was stole people usually using knives or guns, but I was young and dumb enough to think that I could deal with it without a problem. So I continued trying to
          get this girl, then she got pregnant and everybody said she was mine, her boyfriend started to threat me saying that I did it, so the persecution started from him,
          not a good problem for a 14 years old kid, thank good when her child was born she was identical to him and the persecution ended.

            After this, I fell in love with many other unachievable girls that kicked me up quickly, but one of them didn't, she was the best friend the girl of my best friend
            (my best friend at that moment is the guy at the left)so when they started to hang out we went with them and started to flirt each other, and lately we ended up
            kissing and then she and I became couple. Sadly for my friend, his relationship just late for a month, while our relationship late for a bit more than 3 years.
